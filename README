Goal:
	GPU is a new computing resource and it's very powerful. Many applications are using GPU as
accelerators to get real-time processing ability. Generally, there would be more than one GPU
residing in a big GPU Cluster. To uniformly distribute tasks among these GPUs, we need to know
the GPU usage information before the distribution.

	This tool uses NVML + Netty + Spring to provide GPU information with a simple server/client
model. This is just a POC version, I will keep improving this project.

	Hope it's helpful to you guys.

How to use:
	1, Execute command at the root directory of this project :
	    mvn package
	2, Then
	    ./bin/hgMonitor.sh start|stop
